# Neuroqa-Website
This is the website for a moonshot project I've worked on. At Neuroqa, the mission is to help those who suffer from mental illness, which account for up to 265 million people world wide. Neuroqa is taking a different approach, where instead of focusing entirely on the brain, we focus on tackling issues in the microbiome. Recent and promising research shows that there are strong correlation between the bacteria in your gut and your mental wellbeing. Using these newfound ties, Neuroqa's goal is to help personalize medical treatments for mental illnesses by repurposing and developing probiotics that will help stimulate growth of health bacteria corrolated to a healthy mind.
